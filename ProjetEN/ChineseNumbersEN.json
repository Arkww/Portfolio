  "resultRecap": "For this project I created a deep learning model from scratch using Pytorch to recognize Chinese numbers, I used a dataset of 15 000 images of handwritten Chinese numbers (Credit in the readme) and then trained my model on it, I was able to attain an accuracy of 0.98 on my model and display a confusion matrix to see where my model was making mistakes",
